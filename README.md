# VGBL - Video Game Backlog
Live Link: https://vgbl.netlify.app/


## Description

VGBL is a web application designed to provide users the ability to catalogue and track/organize their growing collection of video gamee. 

## Motivation

The original motivation behind this application involved my own personal need to develop a website that works in similar functionality to other popular web applications such as imbd or myanimelist. I found myself wanting a way to track and organize my collection of video games in a way where I would be able to understand what games were on my radar for the next time I had time to play or if I wanted to indicate a game was just not worth the time. I also used this opportunity to use this project as a means to learn and develop newfound skills in modern day frameworks and libraries in both frontend and backend web development.
